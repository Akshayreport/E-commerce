The ecommerce page is split between the buyer(user) and the seller.

It allows users to view products and add their items to a cart.

Sellers can use this ecommerce page to add their products, along with their description, 
price, search tags and image which will be stored on Firebase database and AWS. 

The product will then be displayed for a user which they can add to their shopping cart 
and purchase. 
The user can log in which has back and front-end user authentication from the 
database using the server.js file. Their accounts are saved in the database and their 
password has been encrypted using “bcrypt” method for additional security.

Please note that the firebase database code and AWS passwords has been deleted to 
protect my account from having unauthorised uploads.
